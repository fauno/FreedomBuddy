#+TITLE: Hosting FreedomBuddy
#+OPTIONS: d:t
#+LINK_UP:  ./
#+LINK_HOME: ../

* Introduction

FreedomBuddy can publish its own repository by including the [[https://gitorious.org/project-publish][Project Publish]]
project.  I recommend using a reverse proxy of some sort, like [[http://pagekite.net][PageKite]], for
publishing your work.

* How To

These instructions explain how to start hosting the FreedomBuddy project with
the Project Publish tool.  Publishing requires four basic steps:

1. Get the source code.
2. Create a landing page.
3. Configure the tool.
4. Start publishing!

** Get Project Publish

In FreedomBuddy's root directory, run:

: git clone git://gitorious.org/project-publish/project-publish.git publish

** Create an Index File

Also in FreedomBuddy's root directory, create an index.html file that looks like
this:

#+begin_src html
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>FreedomBuddy</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p>Welcome to FreedomBuddy!</p>
      <p>See the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="wiki">Wiki</a></li>
        <li><a href="issues">Issues</a></li>
        <li><a href="src">Source</a></li>
        <li><a href="current.tar.gz">Current Repository Snapshot</a></li>
        <li><a href="publish">Publishing Tools</a></li>
      </ul>
    </body>
  </html>
#+end_src

** Configure

Now, link the issue and wiki directories that we need to compile:

: cd publish
: ln -s ../issues .
: ln -s ../wiki .

** Publish

Finally, publish your project:

: bash hosting.sh

Your project is now available on [[http://localhost:8000][port 8000]].  =hosting.sh= takes additional
configuration arguments, please see the source file for details, it's pretty
darn simple.

* Congratulations!

You've just published your project!  Now, sign up for [[http://pagekite.net][PageKite]], or similar
reverse proxies, to make your publication easy to access.
