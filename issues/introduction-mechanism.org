* Issue

  It's pretty difficult to introduce folks to one another right now.  The
  requirements aren't even written down anywhere.

* Fixes [0/2]

** TODO Enumerate Required Data

   - PGP certificate (bi-directional)

   - One or more connection method's data. (receiver to sender)

   - Connector-specific data:

     - HTTP:

       - Server Location / Hidden Service Address

       - SSL Certificate

** TODO Create Introduction (Identity Exchange) Mechanism

   Users should be able to write an email or print out a document that contains
   all the information they need to exchange data with friends.
