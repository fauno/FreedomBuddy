* Issue

  Clients can't currently proxy requests for one another.  They should.

  Right now, FBuddy is great for one-off communications, but doesn't try to
  produce a trust-web.  If I know Alice and Bob, Alice can't ask me to introduce
  her to Bob, via FBuddy.

  That, to me, seems like an advantage and a disadvantage.  There could be some
  sort of overlay message layer atop this one that handles those sorts of
  messages, but why bother creating yet another messaging layer when the one we
  have is designed for exactly these sorts of interactions?

  If we only allow proxying (and not searching), then Alice needs to know the
  trust-web structure to pass Bob a message.  If she knows that, then why not
  let her do that?

  Anonymity-preserving-searching is much harder, and may be impossible (aside
  from the good folks at [[http://code.google.com/p/phantom][Phantom]].
