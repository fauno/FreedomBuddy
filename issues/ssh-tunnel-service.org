* Issue

  SSH Tunnels are pretty darn easy to put together.  We can build one of these
  pretty quickly.

* Fixes [0/1]

*** [2012-10-27 Sat]

    Dissecting the command line:

    #+begin_ascii
    $ ssh -f user@personal-server.com -L 2000:personal-server.com:25 -N

    The -f tells ssh to go into the background just before it executes the
    command.  This is followed by the username and server you are logging into.
    The -L 2000:personal-server.com:25 is in the form of -L
    local-port:host:remote-port.  Finally the -N instructs OpenSSH to not
    execute a command on the remote system.
    #+end_ascii

    Data points:

    - login:

      - user
      - server
      - password / cert

    - ports:

      - in port
      - out port
      - server

    This doesn't make multi-hop tunneling easy.  That's out of scope for now.
